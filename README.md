# FitbitOS MkII clock face
My first attempt at a simple clock face, leaning heavily on the code and comments in
the Really Basic clockface by Giampaolo Frello https://github.com/gpfrello/FitbitOS-Really-Basic
Adapted for atlas, and featuring the following information:
- steps 
- active minutes
- heart rate
- time in 12h format
- date
- battery level
